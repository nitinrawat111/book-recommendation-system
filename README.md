# Book Recommendation System
A book recommendation system based on UCSD Book Graph dataset. <br/> <br/>
It uses 3 different Models to recommend books for a given user:

- **Model 1: Popularity Based model**
  - In this model, all books in the dataset are sorted by popularity and most popular books are recommended.

- **Model 2: Collaborative Filtering**
  - In this model, we found the users who liked the same books as us and recommended the other books that they liked.

- **Model 3: Collaborative Filtering II**
  -  In this model, we found the users whose given ratings are most similar to us and recommended the books that they rated high.

# Additional Details
For detailed information on each model and their implementation, please refer to Powerpoint Presentation in the repository.
